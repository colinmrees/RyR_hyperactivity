# Detailed model of Rabit cardiac electrophysiology and cardiac arrhythmia due to RyR Hyperactivity

This code implements a detailed rabbit ventricular myocyte model which demonstrates that late aberrant Ca2+ releases caused by RyR hyperactivity promote EADs and underlie the enhanced triggered activity through increased forward mode of NCX as described in the following publication:

The code to simulate the mouse ventricular myocyte model is based on an earlier rabbit ventricular myocyte model described in:
